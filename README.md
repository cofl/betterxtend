betterxtend
===========

Because xtend is just sad.

Creating an object merge function is one of the initiations to Javascript, in my opinion. The xtend library, therefore, is sad. Their solution is two file. Their solution lacks deep merging of objects and arrays. I sought to better that, and I have, in under five minutes, minus time to figure out git again.
